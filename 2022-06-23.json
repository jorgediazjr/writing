                Hello.
                My name is jorge diaz jr.
                Which doesn't mean much right ?
                It's just a name after all.
                But as you read more posts (if you decide it's worth your time), you will come to have some idea of who the person is behind the words you read.

                So why am I writing?
                Mainly for myself.
                (Pretty selfish huh).
                To become good at writing (duh), thinking, communicating, all while sharing my personal faith, beliefs, thoughts, ideas, etc.
                And I pray it is a blessing to someone.
